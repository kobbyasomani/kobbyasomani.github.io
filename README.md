## Purpose 
This website is the first major project for the Coder Academy full-stack web develpoment bootcamp.

The purpose of the site is to demonstrate the skills we have learned over the first five weeks of the course by building a live website.

The site provides a space to practice implementing the technologies learned so far; showcase work and professional background to prospective employers, and also to share a little bit about personal interests and hobbies.

## Functionality / Features
Our brief was to design and build a site consisting of at least four pages, that incorporated at least four text and graphical 'components' built using a combination of HTML and CSS.

### Sitemap


### Responsive layout
One of the key requirements was that the site be responsive, with a recommendation to follow a mobile-first approach.
- I designed each page with sections comprised of flexbox rows, so that the number and width of columns could be controlled at different layout sizes

- I made extensive use of CSS flexboxes to build rows and columns 

### Responsive Menu

### Card Components

### CSS Animations
- I used the CSS transition property to add simple but elegant animations for interactions such as mousing over menu items, buttons, and cards.
